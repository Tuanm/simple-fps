# A Very Simple First-Person Shooting Game

Just found this in the trash. I remember that I made this shit about 6 months ago.

The rule of its is kind of trying to defeat the _big black guy_ in the middle of the map, dodging from the fire of so fucking many _tiny black guys_ (or you can kill 'em).

My memory doesn't tell me exactly how to win this game. Maybe you can complete it after getting _particular scores_. Who knows? Just try it!

Thank you, [Unity Engine](https://unity.com)! You have great tutorials for beginners.

PS: I __will__ fix some issues and add few features (if I have time, and, of course, if it is in my possibility ðŸ¤£).
